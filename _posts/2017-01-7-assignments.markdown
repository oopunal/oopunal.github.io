Please read carefully the general rules for the delivery of assignments:

> If an assignment is delivered after the deadline, 1.0 points will be subtracted to the total assignment grade for each day that elapses. 

> All assignments must be sent to **oopunal@gmail.com**, if an assignment is delivered to the wrong email, 0.5 points will be subtracted from the total assignment grade.

> If an assignment is delivered with the wrong subject, 0.5 points will be subtracted from the total assignment grade.

> The body of the message for all assignments must contain a list with the names of the team members. 

> If two or more assignments are exactly the same (in one or more points), the total assignment grade for each team will be 0.0.
